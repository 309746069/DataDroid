DataProxy
=========

This project is a development library for the Android platform. The purpose of this library is to ease the use of webservices in an Android application. It is based on the first solution shown in the presentation "[Developing RESTful Android applications](http://www.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions/developing-RESTful-android-apps.html)" that was given at Google I/O 2010.

DataProxy has been developed for Android 1.6 and greater. It may work on Android 1.5 but I haven't tested it on this version and I will not provide support for this version as it is way too old ...
